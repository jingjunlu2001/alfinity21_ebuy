This is the final project for Alfinity 2021 Ebuy track. Given the database of Ebuy’s 3 restaurant outlets along with their 3 years’ worth of purchasing and the sales record and the recommended amount of the raw materials needed for each dishes, we were going to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to develop an algorithm to provide Ebuy's users with the accurate ordering amount based on historical database and assumptions. Specifically, we used an LSTM model to successfully predict the purchasing amount for December 2020 using data from Januarary 2018 to November 2020.
